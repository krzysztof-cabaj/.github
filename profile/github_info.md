# Silvanus Organization

## Teams and Roles

Teams are groups of organization members that reflect Silvanus main projects with cascading access permissions and mentions. Each team has its own page within the organization. On a team's page, you can view **team members**, **child teams**, and the **team's repositories**.

We try to reflect Silvanus projects' hierarchy within the organization with multiple levels of **nested** teams. A *parent* team can have multiple *child* teams, while each *child* team only has one *parent* team.

There are certain organization **roles** that can be assigned to individuals or teams to control the members' access to the organization and its resources. Team-level roles are roles that give permissions to manage a team.

We will give you the **team maintainer** role in every team you request to join, which will give you a number of administrative permissions over the team.

### Request to Join a team
1) In the top right corner of GitHub.com, click your profile photo, then click **Your organizations**.
2) Click the name of your organization *(silvanus-prj)*.
3) Under the organization name, click **Teams** tab.
4) On the **Teams** tab, click the name of the team you want to join *(parent or child team)*.
5) At the top of the team page, click  **Members**.
6) Above the list of team members, click **Request to join**.

After we accept your request, we will give you also the team maintainer role.

### Team Maintainer
As a team maintainer, you can manage team membership and settings such as:

- [Add/Remove organization members to the team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team)
- [Request to add a child team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/requesting-to-add-a-child-team)
- [Request to add or change a parent team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/requesting-to-add-or-change-a-parent-team) 

For more information, see also the [About team maintainers](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/assigning-the-team-maintainer-role-to-a-team-member#about-team-maintainers).

## Repositories

For each repository that you administer on GitHub, you can see an overview of every team or person with access to the repository. From the overview, you can also **invite new teams**, change each team or person's role for the repository, or remove access to the repository.

### Manage team access to an organization repository

You can give a team access to a repository or change a team's level of access to a repository in your repository settings. This will help you also **group** the repositories under your teams with specific permissions.

For more information, see [Managing teams and people with access to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#inviting-a-team-or-person).

### Base Permissions

The base permissions for an organization is the **default** repository permission that apply to all members of an organization when accessing any of the organization's repositories. Base permissions do not apply to outside collaborators.

We have set the base permission to **Read**.

This means that in order to give an organization member aditional access to your repository, youâ€™ll need to **add them to teams** or make them collaborators on individual repositories.

For more information, see [Repository roles for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization).
